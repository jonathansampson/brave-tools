# Description

In 2017 [Brave] used the [Niceware library][niceware] to generate _random-yet-memorable_ passphrases (or, "recovery key") for Brave Rewards (at the time called _Brave Payments_). These phrases were 16-words long, and were generated from a wordlist containing 65,536 distinct words. Not too long afterwards, the decision to use [BIP39] was made instead.

This small repo is meant to hold a duplicate, and _more easily scrutable_ copy of the in-situ tool offered on https://brave.com/faq/#convert-old-keys. With this tool, users who happen to have one of the older Niceware-derived recovery keys can easily convert those keys into a 24-word BIP39 recovery key.

# Usage Options

## Brave FAQ Converter

This embeded module does not send or receive words, passphrases, or bytes outside of the initial download of the bundled Niceware and BIP39 libraries themselves, and this is prior to any user-interaction takes place. You can use this utility to convert your older keys if you like. If you are uncomfortable with this approach, consider the following options.

## Converter on GitHub Pages

I've provided more than the source files in this repo. I also included the `dist/` output, so that you can access the same module here on GitHub. Here you can also open your browser's developer tools and monitor the network activity if you'd like to make sure nothing is going across the wire.

See https://jonathansampson.github.io/brave-tools/bip39-from-niceware/dist/

## Run Locally via `localhost`

If you're comfortable with GitHub, you can clone this repository, build it locally, and run it from _localhost_. For this approach, you'll need to have [git] and [nodejs] installed, as well as know how to stand-up a localhost server. Be sure to set `/dist` as the root when you launch your localhost server.

## Run Locally via Command-Line

There is a smaller, lighter script which doesn't require localhost to run available. It's in the `n2b.js` file. This approach requires [git] and [nodejs] to run. Words from the original 16-word phrase are provided as space-seperated arguments:

```
> git clone git@github.com:jonathansampson/brave-tools.git
> cd brave-tools/bip39-from-niceware
> npm install
> node n2b 16-word-passphrase
< Your new phrase is: 24-word-passphrase
```

The last line would look something like this:

```
> node n2b wreath feint durneder worrier jenny ladrone pinochle nonelective secrete seemed overcrowding kiln refusing vaccination haploidy garnishable
< Your new phrase is: worth tuna expect light garlic stumble solar puzzle weather badge picnic bean evolve tired bunker actress iron interest kidney transfer alcohol coral funny nurse
```

The first phrase is converted into a Buffer whose bytes are then sent to BIP39 to generate the new phrase. As such, the following all represent the same value:

| Niceware (16-words) | Bytes (32) | BIP39 (24-words) |
| :------- | :---- | :---- |
| wreath feint durneder worrier jenny ladrone pinochle nonelective secrete seemed overcrowding kiln refusing vaccination haploidy garnishable | 253, 253, 77, 65, 64, 197, 253, 175, 115, 157, 119, 248, 162, 46, 144, 137, 196, 227, 197, 71, 152, 22, 118, 78, 181, 233, 243, 144, 96, 96, 87, 140 | worth tuna expect light garlic stumble solar puzzleâ€¦s iron interest kidney transfer alcohol coral funny nurse |

## Run via RunKit.com

I've uploaded a small node-app to https://runkit.com/jonathansampson/convert-16-word-niceware-into-24-word-bip39. You can modify the words provided in that source to reflect your own 16-word key recovery phrase, and execute the code.
